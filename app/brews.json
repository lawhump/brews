Spicy phenols wrap around its dry maltiness, which is similar to crusty bread, highlighted by some pithy notes of green banana. Spicy hops, with a flare from the alcohol, provide a nice bite along with a moderate grassy bitterness."

The softness returns as a mildly sweet malt profile, with dried raisins, powdery dark chocolate, sweet cherries soaked in alcohol and a slight tartness of strawberries."
